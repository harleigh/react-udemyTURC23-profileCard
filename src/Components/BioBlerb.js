                Each day is a gift. I love to create, to develop, I love to learn, to research. My area of
                interest is optimization and of which I am a published author. I enjoy using React
                as a frontend for projects involving optimization or automation. I want to make peoples lives
                better, starting with my family and working outwards in Him.
